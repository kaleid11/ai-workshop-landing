## The 4-Part Prompt Formula

Every powerful prompt follows this structure:

### 1. **Persona** - Who are you?
Define the role or expertise level you want the AI to adopt.

**Example:**
> "You are a social media marketing expert with 10 years of experience in B2B SaaS growth"

### 2. **Task** - What should it do?
Be specific about the action you want.

**Example:**
> "Create 5 LinkedIn post ideas for a B2B SaaS company"

### 3. **Context** - What's the situation?
Provide background information and constraints.

**Example:**
> "Our target audience is HR directors, our budget is $5K/month, we focus on employee retention solutions"

### 4. **Format** - How should it present it?
Specify the output structure.

**Example:**
> "Format as a numbered list with headline, body text, and 3 relevant hashtags for each post"

## Complete Prompt Example

```
You are a social media marketing expert with 10 years of B2B SaaS experience.

Create 5 LinkedIn post ideas for a B2B SaaS company that sells employee retention software.

Our target audience is HR directors at companies with 100-1000 employees. 
Our budget is $5K/month for marketing. 
We focus on reducing turnover and improving company culture.

Format each post as:
- Headline (under 100 characters)
- Body text (150-200 words)
- Call-to-action
- 3 relevant hashtags

Make posts educational, not salesy.
```

## 6 Quick Tips for Beginners

### 1. **Be Specific**
Vague prompts = vague results. The more detail, the better.

**❌ Bad:** "Write a social media post"
**✅ Good:** "Write a LinkedIn post about remote work benefits for HR directors, 150 words, professional tone"

### 2. **Use Examples**
Show what good looks like.

**✅ Good:** "Create posts similar to these examples: [paste 2-3 examples]"

### 3. **Iterate**
Refine based on results. If the output isn't perfect, ask follow-up questions.

**✅ Good:** "Make it more conversational" or "Add more statistics"

### 4. **Test Variations**
Try different phrasings and approaches.

**✅ Good:** Test both "Write a post about..." and "Create a post that..."

### 5. **Save Templates**
Create reusable prompt templates for recurring tasks.

**✅ Good:** Save your best prompts as templates for future use

### 6. **Combine Prompts**
Use output from one prompt as input for another.

**✅ Good:** Generate ideas → Expand on best idea → Create variations
