## The Secret to Great Prompts: 4 Simple Parts

Every good prompt has 4 ingredients. You don't need all 4 every time, but using a few makes a huge difference!

### 1. 👤 Persona (Who)
Tell Gemini who you are OR who it should act as.

**Examples:**
- "I am a social media manager for a wellness brand..."
- "You are an expert copywriter..."
- "Act as a marketing consultant..."

### 2. ✅ Task (What) - **MOST IMPORTANT!**
Tell Gemini what to DO. Always use an action word (verb).

**Good verbs:**
- Write, Create, Generate, Summarize, Draft, Analyze, Research, Brainstorm, Rewrite, Organize

**Examples:**
- "Write 3 Instagram captions..."
- "Summarize this meeting notes document..."
- "Generate 5 blog post ideas..."

### 3. 📋 Context (Details)
Give background information, constraints, or specific details.

**Examples:**
- "...for a wellness brand targeting busy moms aged 30-45"
- "...based on the attached brand guidelines document"
- "...keeping a friendly, conversational tone"

### 4. 📄 Format (How)
Specify how you want the output structured.

**Examples:**
- "Limit to bullet points"
- "Create a table with 3 columns"
- "Write in 3 short paragraphs"
- "Give me 5 options to choose from"

## Example Prompt Formula

```
[Persona] + [Task] + [Context] + [Format]
```

### ❌ Too Short (9 words):
> "Write an Instagram caption about our new product"

### ✅ Just Right (23 words):
> "You are a social media expert. Write 3 Instagram captions for our new organic face serum, targeting health-conscious women aged 25-40. Keep it under 150 characters each."

## 6 Quick Tips for Beginners

### 1. 💬 Use Natural Language
Write like you're talking to a person. Complete sentences work best!

**Example:**
> "Hey Gemini, I need help writing an email to my team about our new social media strategy. Can you draft something professional but friendly?"

### 2. 🎯 Be Specific & Iterate
The more details you give, the better the result. If it's not perfect, just ask again!

**First try:**
> "Write a social media post about coffee"

**Better:**
> "Write an Instagram caption for a photo of iced latte with oat milk. Our coffee shop is cozy and community-focused. Tone should be warm and inviting. Include 3 relevant hashtags."

**Even better (follow-up):**
> "Can you make it shorter and add an emoji at the start?"

### 3. ✂️ Be Concise, Avoid Jargon
Keep it simple! Avoid complicated words or industry jargon Gemini might not understand.

**❌ Confusing:**
> "Leverage synergistic paradigms to optimize our omnichannel engagement metrics"

**✅ Clear:**
> "Help me increase engagement across Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok"

### 4. 💬 Make it a Conversation
Don't try to get it perfect in one shot. Refine with follow-up prompts!

**Conversation example:**
1. "Write a blog post intro about AI tools for small businesses"
2. "Make it more casual and friendly"
3. "Add a question at the end to hook readers"
4. "Perfect! Now write 3 more paragraphs continuing this tone"

### 5. 📁 Use Your Documents
Gemini can read your Google Drive files! Use `@filename` to reference them.

**Example in Google Docs:**
> "Summarize the key points from @Q3 Sales Report and create an executive summary"

**Example in Gemini Advanced:**
> "I've uploaded our brand guidelines. Based on @Brand Guidelines.pdf, write 5 social media captions for our new product launch"

### 6. 🔧 Make Gemini Your Prompt Editor
Not sure if your prompt is good? Ask Gemini to improve it!

**Example:**
> "Make this a power prompt: Write social media posts about coffee"

Gemini will suggest:
> "You are a social media manager for a specialty coffee shop. Create 5 Instagram captions (150 characters each) promoting our new seasonal latte flavors. Target audience is millennials who appreciate artisanal coffee. Tone should be warm, inviting, and slightly playful. Include relevant hashtags."
